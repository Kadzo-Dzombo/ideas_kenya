                        We've helped more founders build startups at the earliest possible stage than most anyone you'll meet, and that means we can help startups avoid the 1,000 landmines that can cause certain failure.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We focus on investing in high-potential software startups at seed stage and earlier, with small teams that include great engineers, designers and product founders. Many companies come to us when they are just two or four people, and we help them get from
                        there to their Series A or B rounds and beyond.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you have an idea that is not reflected in our current portfolio, don’t be dissuaded from pitching us. We’re a firm that has often discovered the next technology wave through the talent in our network. For example, we knew Brian Armstrong through his
                        work on risk management and fraud detection at Airbnb. But his next company had nothing to do with travel or hospitality — it was Coinbase, which has become one of the pre-eminent ways to hold, invest and trade Bitcoin and Ethereum
                        in the world.

                                        We’re a generalist VC and have funded early-stage startups that touch nearly every sector. We have a specific strength in software, and believe that every kind of business will be re-made by great software engineers creating things that are better, cheaper,
                                        and faster than incumbent offerings.

                                        Many of our best investments have come from talented founders who shifted their skills into a new or untested field. For example, when we invested in Kyle Vogt, he hadn’t worked in autonomous vehicles for roughly a decade since his undergraduate years,
                                        but then he went on to create Cruise, which sold to GM for $1 billion. Or when we invested in Brian Armstrong, he had worked in fraud prevention at Airbnb before starting Coinbase.

                                    We are founders and operators who know what it’s like to start and grow a new company. We have created some of the best-known and most loved brands on the modern web and we have worked in disciplines across the industry from engineering to product design
                                    to brand marketing to media relations and public policy. We can help you in specific areas like technical hiring, user acquisition or media outreach because we have people on our team who have done exactly those things
                                    for 10 years or more. As a culture, we value helpfulness, pragmatism and responsiveness. We are investors foremost, not managers. We want to help companies find a path forward, but ultimately, the founders must make
                                    the key decisions.

                                        We focus on early-stage investing, when teams tend to include solely the founders or the founding team plus a few first employees. Many of the teams we talk to have already launched their products and already have the beginnings of a revenue model, although
                                        this is not required. We understand that products and business models evolve, but it’s good to see in a very concrete way how teams are able to ship product and work together.

                                        It’s never too early to start a conversation with us. Often times, we meet founders right when they are starting out and then we invest later once we see progress.

                                    We are proud to have large number of operators who have spent years in engineering, design, communications and policy. First, we use office hours to spend time working through issues that founders commonly face, such as prioritization, hiring and how
                                    and when to structure fundraising. Then we have operators on the team who can come in and help with user acquisition strategy, press launches or product design. Founders can use these services on an as-need basis; we
                                    don’t require companies in the portfolio to use them.
